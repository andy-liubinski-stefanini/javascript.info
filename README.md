# Important notes:
-I skip what does not contain any practice e.g. theory question
-I skip what is way too self explanatory.
-I add number before the folder that correspond with the order of the part on the website
-I name the file as the topic appears on the site unless the name is too long. I shorten the name otherwise, but 
-I copy explanation text into the beginning of each file.
-Depending on the question - some files are HTML with script inside, some are JS files ran in the console.
